Description: Implements the generalized order-restricted information criterion
    approximation (GORICA). The GORICA can be utilized to evaluate (in)equality
    constrained hypotheses. The GORICA is applicable not only to normal linear
    models, but also to generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized linear
    mixed models (GLMMs), and structural equation models (SEMs). In addition,
    the GORICA can be utilized in the context of contingency tables for which
    (in)equality constrained hypotheses do not necessarily contain linear
    restrictions on cell probabilities, but instead often contain non-linear
    restrictions on cell probabilities.
